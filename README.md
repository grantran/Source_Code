# SourceCode

SourceCode was built as our midterm project for Lighthouse Labs. It is a resource-wall similar to Pinterest, where any visitors can view and click on resources contributed by any user. Links re-direct to the appropriate websites. 

Users can also register for an account, and then contribute their own resources, adding a Name, URL, Description, Tags, and an Image which will then be pinned to the "Resource Wall". Users can keep track of their own contributed resources in their profile page.

SourceCode was built on a NodeJS + Express framework connected to a PostgreSQL database, with front-end design using Bootstrap, jQuery, Ajax.
